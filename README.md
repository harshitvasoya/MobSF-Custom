## ‚úÖ Requirements for Windows Setup

> Please ensure you install all the following dependencies **before** proceeding with MobSF installation.

### üß∞ System Prerequisites

| Tool/Package | Version | Download Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Git** | Latest | [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) |
| **Python** | 3.8 - 3.11 | [Download Python](https://www.python.org/) |
| **JDK (Java Development Kit)** | 11 or higher | [Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) |
| **Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools** | Latest | [Download Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022) |
| **OpenSSL (non-light version)** | Latest | [Download OpenSSL](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) |
| **wkhtmltopdf** | Latest | [Download wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html) |

> **Important:** After installing `wkhtmltopdf`, **add its installation directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\wkhtmltopdf\bin`) to your system's `PATH` environment variable.**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Poetry Environment Variable (Optional but Recommended)

MobSF uses `poetry` for managing dependencies. To ensure it can be run from any terminal, you should add its installation location to your system's PATH.

### ‚û§ Step-by-Step Instructions:

1.  **Install Poetry**:
    ```powershell
    pip install poetry
    ```

2.  **Find Poetry's Installation Path**:
    Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell and find where `poetry` was installed.
    ```powershell
    where poetry
    ```
    This will output a path, typically `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python3X\Scripts\poetry.exe`.

3.  **Add the Path to Environment Variables**:
    * Copy the **directory** from the previous step (e.g., `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python3X\Scripts`).
    * Search for "Edit the system environment variables" in the Windows Start Menu and open it.
    * Click the `Environment Variables...` button.
    * In the "User variables" section, select the `Path` variable and click `Edit...`.
    * Click `New` and paste the directory path you copied.
    * Click `OK` on all windows to save the changes. You may need to restart your terminal for the changes to take effect.

## üß™ Dynamic Analysis Setup (Optional)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: For reliable results, dynamic analysis should be performed on a physical device or a high-performance emulator setup. Performance on standard virtual machines (VMs) may vary.

You will need an Android Emulator such as:
* **Genymotion** Desktop or Cloud
* **Android Studio Emulator**

## üõ†Ô∏è Installing MobSF on Windows

Follow the steps below to clone and set up MobSF on your system.

1.  **Clone the MobSF repository**:
    ```powershell
    git clone [https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF.git](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF.git)
    ```

2.  **Change into the project directory**:
    ```powershell
    cd Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF
    ```

3.  **Run the setup script**:
    This script will install all the required Python dependencies.
    ```powershell
    setup.bat
    ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Tip**: Before running `setup.bat`, ensure no other programs (like VSCode) or terminals have the MobSF directory open. File locks can cause permission errors during setup.
